✨ This is a clean, responsive one-pager. You can drop it into any static hosting (GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel) and it will just work.

Would you like me to also make a version with a soft professional color scheme (like navy, teal, and light beige) to give it more personality, or keep it minimal white/gray?

You said:
Can you please run that code
ChatGPT said:
I can’t “run” the HTML as a live website here in chat, but I can render it for you so you can preview how it will look in the browser. Let me package the HTML into a file that you can open directly on your computer.

✅ I’ve generated your site as an HTML file. You can download and open it in any browser:

Download Wendy Sharpe Portfolio Website

Would you like me to also prepare a host-ready version (e.g., with instructions for GitHub Pages or Netlify) so you can put it online quickly? 

You said:
Uploaded image
Could you use this as inspiration for how to make my portfolio look? 
ChatGPT said:
Got it ✅ Thanks for sharing the screenshot — it looks like a modern, minimal portfolio with large typography, split sections, and a project-listing style. I can restyle your site to follow this kind of layout:

Hero section: Big welcoming text (e.g., “Hi, I’m Wendy Sharpe. Welcome to my Portfolio”)

Two-column layout: Left side has project / course submissions in a list; right side shows course/about content and images if you’d like

Minimal neutral colors (beige, off-white, black text)

Clean, airy design with plenty of whitespace

Would you like me to:

Keep it strictly text-focused (like your CV + course info, no stock imagery),
or

Add placeholder images/visuals (like books, research, AI-themed icons) for a closer match to the inspiration design?

You said:
Please just leave space for one small headshot photo. Otherwise no visuals
ChatGPT said:
I’ve updated your portfolio to follow the sleek inspiration style:

A hero header with large intro text and a reserved circular space for a small headshot.

Minimal two-column style sections with generous whitespace.

Simplified typography and neutral palette for elegance.

Would you like me to add a left-hand navigation menu (like in your inspiration screenshot) so visitors can quickly jump between “About Me,” “About the Course,” and “Weekly Submissions”?

You said:
could you please update using the previous commands to use inspiration from the given portfolio and also leaving one space for a small headshot
ChatGPT said:
Your portfolio now has a fixed left-hand navigation menu for easy access to each section, styled in the minimalist layout inspired by the example. I also left a dedicated circular placeholder for your headshot in the hero header.

Would you like me to add a hover highlight effect on the weekly submissions list (so it feels more interactive, like project tiles)?

You said:
Uploaded image
please add this image to the headshot space 
ChatGPT said:
I’ve placed your uploaded image into the circular headshot space in the header. It will now display as the profile photo on your portfolio page.

Would you like me to also add a soft border or shadow around the headshot so it stands out more against the background?

You said:
Please change the Heading to just my name and make it green in colour. The headshot space can have a soft border
ChatGPT said:

Answer in chat instead
I’ve updated the heading so it only displays your name in green, and added a soft border around the headshot for emphasis.

Would you like me to also apply the green accent color to section headings or navigation links for a cohesive theme?
